# Devlog

**Version 2.0** - removed "Passable Foliage" mod, added "Farmer's Delight" addons

**Version 2.1** - the core has been changed to mohist (supports bukkit plugins), the openinv plugin has also been added (I need it so that if my friend finishes playing, I can take his things for other friends, even if he is online)

**Version 2.2** - mod "Hit's tree chop" don't work on server. Because I upload plugin "CrisTreeCapitator", but save Hit's tree chop on modpack on curseforge for signeplayer, and save mod on server, because connecting require it
